=>the event name should be same to send and get info
socket.on and socket.emit

* socket.on(event, listener)


* Usually we do not emit on the server , on the client we do
> Listen on server and then inside we emit 

* We can do entire io ckt emit or socket emit or we can brodcast
    > if we do io emit all of the users will get the response, i mean if by a client(form) we got any response and then i need to emit to entire ckt including me.(real time)
    > broadcast mean except mesocket other sockets on ckt will get the response
io.emit()
io.broadcast.emit()

* to send to particular room io.to(room).emit() and socket.to(room).emit  both works the same way

* socket.join()  > If user (socket) joined particular room and if he sends msg then other users present in that room will get the msg sent and vice-versa.
ex. if both joined a same room , then both will get msgs sent by both.

* MiddleWare > io.use((socket, next) => { middleware task ; next()})
